Filename: GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity
File not in the repository because of it's size

Project info:
Based on dataset cotaining earth surface temperatures for over 3000 locations from 1750 (where avaliable) to 2013. First, data for each location was analysed to check wether mean yearly temperature have risen significantly from baseline - mean temperature in XX century. Then, for 12 randomly chosen cities ARIMA prediction of further temperature rise was performed to find out the mean temperatures for 2050 and check how much it will rise from the same baseline

Repository contains main code file, additional scripts in add_function.py file, jpeg of wold map used in code and requirements
